## What is Mud and Blood 2?
Mud and Blood 2 (MnB2) is a World War II real-time strategy (RTS) game based on small-squad tactics and randomized sandbox game play. It is set in the period of August 1944, during operation LÃ¼ttich. You control the Allied forces, and your only goal is to hold your ground and make sure that the Germans don't punch through your defense line for as long as possible while your Headquarters relocates away from battle. There is no "winning" in MnB2, as the Germans will keep charging your defenses indefinitely. You can only aim to survive as many waves as is possible, while getting as many points as you can. It will be unfair, random, and brutal. This wiki can be a lifesaver, though. It has almost all the info you need to win and even a Strategies section to get some quick and easy strategies.

## How Do I Play Mud and Blood 2?
After waiting for the game to load and clicking the shiny yellow button, you get a screen with three different options at the bottom. "Deploy" is to start the game, "Ops" is your User Profile and it shows you your XP bar, all medals and badges that you've earned throughout your career, the different deployment options you can use and "Intel", which gives you a short explanation on how to play the game.

### The Game Interface 
###### *For deeper reading, see Game Interface*

This game has a minimalistic interface to allow more of a movie-like feel. When opening a game, you will see 6 yellow buttons in the top left-hand corner. 5 of them are categories, the top 5, and the bottom one is the mute button. Clicking on any category will give you more options and different orders to give your men. These can be hidden by the "shift" key. Now, the more interactive interface is the one where you click on the soldiers to move them around. When hovering over an Allied soldier, his stats will appear. When hovering over an Axis soldier, a brief description will appear.

In the older versions, there were no categories for sorting orders, so they were just lined up on both sides of the screen. Also, Germans had no descriptions when hovered over. All infantry was the same speed (Troopers, Spec-Ops, and Signallers were all the same speed). Leaving Germans behind when advancing didn't count as crossing your lines, either, which meant advancing could be taken advantage of.
