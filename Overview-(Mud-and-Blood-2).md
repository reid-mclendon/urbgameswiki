## What is Mud and Blood 2?
Mud and Blood 2 (MnB2) is a World War II real-time strategy (RTS) game based on small-squad tactics and randomized sandbox game play. It is set in the period of August 1944, during operation LÃ¼ttich. You control the Allied forces, and your only goal is to hold your ground and make sure that the Germans don't punch through your defense line for as long as possible while your Headquarters relocates away from battle. There is no "winning" in MnB2, as the Germans will keep charging your defenses indefinitely. You can only aim to survive as many waves as is possible, while getting as many points as you can. It will be unfair, random, and brutal. This wiki can be a lifesaver, though. It has almost all the info you need to win and even a Strategies section to get some quick and easy strategies.
